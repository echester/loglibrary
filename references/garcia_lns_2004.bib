	abstract = {This paper presents a research on arithmetic units targeted to implement model predictive control (MPC) in a custom embedded processor. A novel hardware implementation of cotransformation for the calculation of addition and subtraction in the Logarithmic Number System (LNS) is proposed. This architecture provides a small ROM-less adder/subtracter, with longer operation latency than other LNStechniques, but easily pipelineable. These characteristics make it very adequate for implementing the datapath of custom MPC embeddable microprocessors. A review of the arithmetic customization process is presented, including: an analysis of the finite precision problem, modifications to the standard MPC algorithm that simplify embedding the application, and the reasons that suggest better performance of LNSover standard floating-point (FP) architectures. The proposed arithmetic unit architecture for 16-bit LNSis fully synthesized for ASIC, and compared with an equivalent FP implementation. Area and clock cycle estimates are compared. Finally, considerations on low-precision implementations of LNSarithmetic units are provided, and an embedded-ROM implementation of addition/subtraction in LNSis proposed and analyzed.},
