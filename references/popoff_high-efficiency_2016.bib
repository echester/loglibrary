	abstract = {The logarithmic number system (LNS) has always been an interesting alternative for floating point calculations since the implementation of several arithmetic operations such as divisions, exponentiations and square-roots, which are required for computationally intensive nonlinear functions, is greatly simplified in the logarithmic space. However, additions and subtractions become nonlinear operations that have to be approximated using polynomials for area efficient realizations. A particular challenge is the accuracy within the so-called critical region which is encountered for subtractions where the difference between the operands is close to zero. In the literature, several arithmetic cotransformations that reduce the overhead of approximating these operations have been presented. Even so, the main problem with practical LNS realizations is the area overhead when compared to standard FPUs with comparable accuracy. In this paper, we propose a highly hardware-efficient novel cotransformation concept that not only reduces the area requirements by up to 35\% when compared to the state-of-the-art, but also allows the LNU to calculate single cycle logarithms and exponentiations within the same datapath. We present comprehensive results for a complete processing system that includes the LNU and an OpenRISC based core in 65nm, and 28nm technologies. We compare this implementation with a system using a standard IEEE compliant FPU and show that the LNS based system can outperform its FP counterpart by up to 4.35?? in speed. The final, pipelined LNU system when implemented in 65nm occupies an area of 54.3 kGE, allows 89 MFLOP per second and consumes 15.9???136.7 pJ per operation at 1.2V under typical conditions and 25??C.},
